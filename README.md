We are implementing a deep-learning model in this repository using Recurrent Neural Networks and Bidirectional LSTM for Speech Emotion recognition.

In this project, the dataset used for training the model is the "TESS Toronto emotional speech set data".
I will upload the model, the backend, the UI, and the final model as separate files, respectively.
